## 🎨 Design System

### Typography
- **Font**: Google Fonts Inter
- **Heading**: 22-32px, bold weight
- **Body**: 14-16px, normal weight
- **Labels**: 12-14px, medium weight

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px
- **Section gaps**: 20-32px
- **Card padding**: 16-20px
- **Button height**: 48-80px

### Border Radius
- **Small**: 8-12px (inputs, small cards)
- **Medium**: 16-20px (cards, containers)
- **Large**: 24px (buttons, major sections)

### Shadows
- **Light elevation**: `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`
- **Medium elevation**: `0 4px 12px rgba(255,107,107,0.3)`
- **High elevation**: `0 8px 24px rgba(255,107,107,0.4)`

---

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### State Management
- **Local State**: `setState()` for screen-specific state
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from UI
- **Data Persistence**: `shared_preferences` for local storage

### Design Pattern
- **Service-Repository Pattern**
  - Services handle business logic
  - Local storage abstracted in `StorageService`
  - Models define data structure with `toJson`/`fromJson`

### Data Flow
```
User Action → Screen → Service → Storage → Update State → Re-render UI
```

### Dependencies
- `flutter`: SDK framework
- `google_fonts`: Typography
- `shared_preferences`: Local storage
- `fl_chart`: Charts and graphs
- `intl`: Date/time formatting
- `flutter_local_notifications`: Push notifications
- `timezone`: Time zone handling

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Flutter Not Found**: Running on Replit requires Flutter SDK installation
2. **No Backend**: All data is local-only (no cloud sync)
3. **AI Placeholder**: OpenAI integration needs manual API key setup
4. **No Auth**: Single-user mode currently
5. **Demo Data**: Initial launch includes sample entries

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Warm Colors?
Warm colors (coral, orange, amber) convey energy, motivation, and action - perfect for a fitness app. They create a sense of urgency and excitement that aligns with workout motivation.

### Why Dedicated Water Screen?
Hydration is a critical daily habit. A dedicated screen with visual feedback encourages users to track it consistently rather than burying it in a submenu.

### Why Local Storage First?
For an MVP, local storage provides fast performance and works offline. Cloud sync can be added later without changing the core architecture.

### Why Service Layer?
Separating business logic from UI makes the code testable, maintainable, and easier to refactor when adding features like backend integration.
